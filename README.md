# CLT-RegressionModel-Estimation

## Overview
This project is part of the **Engineering Statistics and Probability** course at the University of Tehran. The project focuses on key statistical concepts such as the **Central Limit Theorem (CLT)**, **parameter estimation**, **applications of mean squared error (MSE)** and involves implementing a simple linear regression model from scratch using Python and calculating the MSE to determine the best-fitting line for a given dataset.
